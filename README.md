## 🌍 React Countries Search App

1. This is a simple React app in this app, you can search for any country and see its details.
2. I used the Countries rest API to fetch the info about each country.
3. I included the Local Storage API in this project to store the search history, and shows the previously searched data when the webpage loaded.
4. I used ReactJS and CSS to build this project.
